My solutions to a college course.

## Solutions
### 1 (Pure JavaScript + JQuery)
A task was to create a simple To Do website using HTML/CSS/JS and JQuery.

The website contains two To Do lists â€” 'Urgent' and 'Not urgent.' Users can add, remove and put back removed tasks, as well as mark them as done and search through them with or without case sensitivity.

![Book](./images/2_4.png)
![Login](./images/2_5.png)

The website contains a list of (randomly generated) housing rentals. Users can search through them with a variety of filters, follow them and book them. Followed rentals are grouped on a separate page. Users can also log in and out with a local login or Firebase. Each action status is displayed with a toast notification. The website was also deployed to Firebase (for the period of a course).
